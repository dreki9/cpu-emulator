# The CPU Emulator
Write a CPU emulator software that support a basic instruction set (15 instructions) given below. Assume that the 
computer has 256 bytes of available memory (M) initially set to zero. Your emulator should load a program code 
from a text file. For the simplicity you can store the program code in any data type you like.
Following example code is an app that can compute the sum of the numbers between 0 and 20. Your emulator 
must execute this sample code at minimum. Note that I may test your emulator with any code that supported by 
the instruction set. You can implement your code in Java or C. Assume that initially all flags are set to zero
